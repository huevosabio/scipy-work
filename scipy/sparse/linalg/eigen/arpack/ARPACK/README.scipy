This directory contains a bundled version of ARPACK-NG 3.1.3,
http://forge.scilab.org/index.php/p/arpack-ng/

NOTE FOR VENDORS: it is in general safe to use a system version of ARPACK
instead. Note, however, that earlier versions of ARPACK and ARPACK-NG had
certain bugs, so using those over the bundled version is not recommended.

The bundled version has the following patch applied:

(i) Using a UTIL/second_cputime.f which calls the Fortran intrinsic
CPU_TIME function instead of ETIME.
